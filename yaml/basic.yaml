# Mappings:
# - associative arrays, hash tables, key-value pairs, collection
# - denoted with a colon and a space ":"
# - no duplicate keys
# - mappings can be nested

# example:

# Flow styles:
# - use curly brackets and commas 
datacenters: {location: usa, cab: 12}

# Sequencees:
# - lists, arrays, collections
# - denoted with a dash and a space "-"
# - can be combined with mappings
#   - mapping of sequences 
#   - sequence of mappings
# Sequences cann't be blank or nested without mapping
